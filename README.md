This project describes a microcontroller based model used to 
count the number of persons entering in a particular room and 
accordingly Fan in the room will be ON and Infrared sensors are used to count the 
number of persons.The main purpose of our proposed system is to save energy by 
making the fans ON or OFF according to the presence of the 
person in a room, to reduce the efforts required to switch on the 
lights and for the security reasons.
